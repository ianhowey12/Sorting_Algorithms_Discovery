# Sorting_Algorithms_Discovery
Code implementations, descriptions, fundamental information, testing, and barchart visualizations of 59 different sorting algorithms and 84 total sorting processes.

Allows testing every algorithm on sorting a vector of ints with customizable size. You can choose from the list of sorting processes provided or create your own custom sort using one of the algorithms in sorts.cpp.

Descriptions of the sorting algorithms and fundamental basic info (time complexity, space complexity, stability, etc.) are provided and can be obtained one at a time or for every algorithm.

Text-based barchart visualizations are fully customizable, letting you experiment with the impact of the size of the vector on the time needed to sort it via the chosen algorithm.

Keep in mind that the exact implementations of these algorithms may differ from source to source and thus, the algorithms may differ in performance as well.

My implementations do not each reflect one "official" set of rules and only follow loose ideas characterizing each algorithm. I do not claim to have invented these ideas, nor do I claim responsibility for "proper" algorithm design. My implementations are based solely on the general principles of the algorithms; their exact processes follow logically from these principles. Therefore, implementations by other users may function the same as a result.
